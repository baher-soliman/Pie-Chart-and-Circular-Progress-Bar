Pie-Chart-and-Circular-Progress-Bar
===================================
Two lightweight JQuery plugins.
The first is a pie chart that can display statistics for several items in a pie chart view.
And the other is a circular progress bar that shows the progress in percentage for a certain item in a circular bar view instead of the normal horizontal bar.
